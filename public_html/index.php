				<p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
					transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong
					to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.</p>
